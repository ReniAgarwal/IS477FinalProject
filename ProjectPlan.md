**Overview**

The goal of this project is to explore how a country's happiness and well-being indicators relate to the prevalence of mental health disorders. We plan to merge two datasets that include information about global happiness scores and rates of mental health disorders. By analyzing these together, we hope to identify patterns that show how economic and social factors might influence mental health outcomes across countries. We will also see whether happiness and well-being data can help predict levels of depression or anxiety.

**Research Questions**

How do happiness and well-being factors such as GDP per capita, social support, and healthy life expectancy relate to the prevalence of mental health disorders across countries?

Can we build a model that predicts depression or anxiety prevalence based on happiness indicators?

Have global mental health disorder rates changed alongside happiness trends over time, and are there any countries that stand out as exceptions?

**Datasets**

We are using two datasets from Kaggle:

Uncover Global Trends in Mental Health Disorder – This dataset contains country-level information on the prevalence of different mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. It covers multiple years and provides a good overview of trends across time.

World Happiness Index Report – This dataset includes information about countries’ happiness scores and the factors that influence them, such as GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

We will connect the two datasets using country and year as the linking variables. This will allow us to study relationships and trends over time. Both datasets include enough data to run correlations, visual analyses, and basic predictive models.

**Team: Dhruval and Reni**

Dhruval will focus on cleaning and integrating the datasets, preparing the merged data, and developing the predictive models.

Reni will focus on exploratory data analysis, creating visualizations, interpreting results, and writing the summary report.

Both will collaborate on reviewing the code, writing conclusions, and preparing the presentation.

**Timeline**

Step 1: Explore both datasets, review data dictionaries, and outline the cleaning and integration plan.

Step 2: Clean and prepare the datasets, handle missing data, and align years. Dhruval will take the lead on this while Reni documents the process.

Step 3: Merge the datasets and verify that countries and years align correctly. Dhruval will handle the technical merge, and Reni will begin exploring relationships through visualizations.

Step 4: Develop and test models to identify relationships and possible predictors. Dhruval will focus on the model-building, while Reni evaluates results and refines visuals.

Step 5: Interpret findings, summarize insights, and prepare the final report. Reni will write the analysis section, and Dhruval will finalize outputs and code for the repository.

Step 6: Combine everything into the final presentation and submission materials together.

**Constraints**

Some countries or years may have missing data, which can limit the sample size. The two datasets might not perfectly overlap in time or coverage. Measurement differences between data sources could affect consistency. The project will focus on relationships and predictive patterns but will not make causal claims.

**Gaps**

We still need to check which years overlap between the datasets and whether all key indicators are available for the same countries. Some additional context from outside data sources, like economic or education statistics, might improve model accuracy. We also need to decide whether to focus on a few specific disorders or analyze all of them together.
