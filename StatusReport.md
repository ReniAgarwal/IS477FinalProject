**Task Update**

In the Project Plan the team outlined six steps for looking through the world happiness index and the mental health datasets, those being: 

Step 1: Explore both datasets, review data dictionaries, and outline the cleaning and integration plan.

Step 2: Clean and prepare the datasets, handle missing data, and align years.

Step 3: Merge the datasets and verify that countries and years align correctly.

Step 4: Develop and test models to identify relationships and possible predictors.

Step 5: Interpret findings, summarize insights, and prepare the final report. 

Step 6: Combine everything into the final presentation and submission materials.

Of these steps, the first three have been completed, with the data having been aligned and merged into one dataset, with the Project-Check notebook in the repository being the code to merge the datasets, as well as being code to create visualizations with the merged dataset to further explore the data and understand relationships between variables. These visualizations are the World Happiness Graphs and MentalHealthVHappinessScore2017 file and they give us an understanding of how different countries scored on the Happiness Index throughout the mid-2010s and how different rates of mental illness in a country may factor into the Happiness Score of the country. Going forward, we will use this understanding and the merged dataset to develop the model.
